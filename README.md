Build notes: Make sure you add the dependency for openCSV, included in the base directory.
Sample data is loaded from a file directory string in the source, so you will need to change that when compiling/running on different machines.

Functions:
Naive dictionary compression/decompression
Value encoding/decoding for integer values
